# Object-Tracking-with-Bounding-Boxes-in-Video-Frames
This project implements an object tracking system that associates detected objects across video frames based on their class labels and proximity. It uses bounding boxes to localize objects and assigns unique class-based labels for visualization. The output is a video with tracked objects, showing their labels frame by frame
